**Project: Biodigester**

The biodigester project, developed by the engineering team at Intechno in partnership with the environmental brand and UCL college, is an initiative that combines technology and sustainability. The main goal is to create a didactic tool for related disciplines and also serve as a research instrument.

**Automation Description:**

* **PLC:** The system is controlled by the Delta DVP28SV11R2 PLC, a robust and reliable programmable controller.
Expansion Module: The Delta DVP04PT-S expansion module is used to expand the input and output capabilities of the system, ensuring greater flexibility and control.
* **HMI:** The Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is achieved through the Delta DOP-103WQ 4.3" HMI. This interface is crucial for system interaction, allowing for efficient monitoring and control.

**Control Logic:**

* **Ladder Development:** Signal reading and valve actuation logic was developed using ladder language, using Delta's IPSoft software. This provides intuitive programming that is easy to understand, facilitating maintenance and future system development.
* **Modbus Communication:** Additionally, the project features Modbus communication, enabling integration and data exchange with other devices. This allows for the collection of information such as temperature, pressure, level, among other parameters of the device, expanding the possibilities for process analysis and control.
